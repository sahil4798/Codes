      <p>
        The wolf (Canis lupus;[b] pl: wolves), also known as the gray wolf
        orgrey wolf, is a large canine native to Eurasia and North America.
        Morethan thirty subspecies of Canis lupus have been recognized, and gray
        wolves, as popularly understood, comprise wild subspecies. The wolf
        isthe largest extant member of the family Canidae. It is
        alsodistinguished from other Canis species by its lesspointed ears
        andmuzzle, as well as a shorter torso and a longer tail. The wolf
        isnonetheless related closely enough to smaller Canis species, such as
        the coyote and the golden jackal, to produce fertile hybrids with them.
        Thebanded fur of a wolf is usually mottled white, brown, gray, and
        black,although subspecies in the arctic region may be nearly all white.
