          <h1>Sanji</h1>
          <p>
            "Black Leg" Sanji,[12] born as Vinsmoke Sanji,[22][23][24] is the
            cook of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Senior Officers of the
            Straw Hat Grand Fleet.[5] He is the fifth member of the crew and the
            fourth to join, doing so at the end of the Baratie Arc. Born as the
            third son and fourth child of the Vinsmoke Family[25] (Thus, making
            him a former prince of the Germa Kingdom), he disowned his family
            twice, once in his youth and again after reuniting with them as an
            adult.[26] After fleeing the Vinsmokes as a child, he eventually
            entered the care of Zeff as the sous chef of the Baratie, where he
            would remain until he met Monkey D. Luffy, who convinced him to join
            his crew. His dream is to find the rumored chef's paradise, All
            Blue, which is where East Blue, West Blue, North Blue, and South
            Blue meet, along with their wildlife. He is one of the top three
            fighters of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and Zoro.[27][28]He
            first gained a bounty of Beli.png77,000,000 for his role in the raid
            on Enies Lobby. It increased to Beli.png177,000,000 after the
            Dressrosa Arc, but the condition of his bounty was changed to Only
            Alive due to his biological father's interference. After he escaped
            from Big Mom's territory, his bounty condition was reverted back to
            Dead or Alive, and its value increased to Beli.png330,000,000.[20]
            Following the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was increased to
            Beli.png1,032,000,000.[5] Despite renouncing his surname
            Vinsmoke,[23] the World Government labels it as part of his name on
            his wanted poster.[24]

          <h2>Powers and abilities</h2>
          <p>
            As the cook of the Straw Hat Pirates, Sanji provides an extremely
            valuable service to his crewmates. He is one of the crew's top four
            fighters along with Luffy, Zoro, and Jinbe. Sanji is also a member
            of the "Monster Trio" among the Straw Hat Crew due to his great
            strength.[22][23] He currently has the fourth highest bounty in the
            crew after Luffy, Zoro, and Jinbe, at Beli.png1,032,000,000.[24]
            Alongside Jinbe, Sanji is one of two members of the crew to fight
            without weapons or Devil Fruit powers in combat, until acquiring the
            Raid Suit, but then abandoned it as his dormant genetic enhancements
            awakened. While Luffy often fights the strongest enemies, Sanji and
            Zoro often end up fighting against enemies considered the second or
            third primary threat. On occasion, he would take on an opponent
            weaker than Zoro's; an example of this being Sanji fighting against
            Jabra of CP9, who had a slightly lower Doriki than Kaku, who lost to
            Zoro. However, Sanji's and Zoro's opponents could be often
            characterized as matching (or countering) their particular fighting
            styles, such as his fight against another leg-based martial artist,
            Mr. 2, during the Arabasta Arc, while Zoro fought against Mr. 1, an
            assassin who ate a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that made him a
            Fullbody Bladed Human resistant to swords. Although Sanji and Zoro
            usually let their rivalry impede their fighting performances, they
            have proven to be a near-unstoppable force if they agree to
            cooperate for the battle.[25] As a member of the infamous Vinsmoke
            Family, Sanji was raised and trained from an early age alongside the
            rest of his siblings in warfare and combat. Their father modified
            them while their mother was still pregnant in order to endow them
            with superhuman abilities. However, due to Sora's own attempt at
            ensuring her sons would keep their emotions using a counter-drug,
            Sanji's genetic modifications were repressed, and he was born a
            normal human.

          <h2>Persnality</h2>
          <p>
            One of Sanji's most easily noticeable characteristics is the kind,
            calm, cool, and collected manner in which he carries himself. He
            tends to speak in a very composed manner, even in dire situations,
            and rarely acts without thinking. His demeanor in a lot of ways can
            be compared to that of a secret agent. This is amplified by the fact
            that he tends to wear a suit, very often enjoys a smoke, and in the
            anime, they tend to play smooth music with jazzy undertones when he
            speaks. He quite often makes comedic exceptions to this, such as
            when in the presence of beautiful women, or when angered by a crew
            member. Like Zoro, he is more perceptive than he seems, and often
            tells people what they need to hear instead of what they want.
            Hence, he is seen as one of the more hardened members of the crew.
            For example, when the Straw Hats first meet Laboon and learn that
            the whale had been waiting for 50 years for a reunion with his crew,
            it is Sanji who immediately (and correctly) points out that Laboon's
            crew is most likely dead. Sanji does possess an optimistic and
            idealistic side. His dream is to find a sea that even other cooks
            consider mythical. Furthermore, even after the abuse, he experienced
            from his family as a child, he held out hope that they may have
            changed for the better. However, this hope proves to be completely
            futile, but he was angrier than surprised at the revelation, showing
            that he maintains a healthy sense of skepticism even at his most
            hopeful. Sanji also showed a high degree of faith in his fianc√©e,
            Charlotte Pudding, and was horrified and downcast when he discovered
            her true motive. Like Franky (and unlike Zoro), Sanji is not afraid
            to show his emotions when the moment calls for it and is entirely
            capable of crying or losing his temper, which results in Sanji's
            short fuse and subsequent beatings of most villains (and Luffy). In
            fact, a running gag has appeared since Sanji's fight with Jabra,
            during which he stated that when he gets angry, he "heats up". After
            this fight, when Sanji gets particularly angry at a villain, he
            appears to burst into flames. This occurs with both Absalom and
            Duval, though the latter example appears only in the anime. It is
            also seen when Luffy states nonchalantly that he is friends with Boa
            Hancock, considered to be the most beautiful woman, when she appears
            to prevent a Marine ship from sinking the Thousand Sunny.
