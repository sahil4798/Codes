      <h1>Roronoa Zoro</h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Roronoa Zoro,[19] also known as
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Hunter"
          >"Pirate Hunter"</a
        >
        " Zoro,[8] is the combatant of the Straw Hat Pirates, one of their two
        swordsmen, one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet,[3]
        and is publicly recognized as the right-hand man of his crew's captain
        Monkey D. Luffy.[20][21] Formerly a bounty hunter,[5] he is the second
        member of Luffy's crew and the first to join it, doing so in the Romance
        Dawn Arc.[2]
      </p>
      <p>
        As a master of Three Sword Style, a swordsmanship style which he created
        during his childhood training in Shimotsuki Village, Zoro is among the
        three most powerful combatants of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and
        Sanji.[22][23] His dream is to become the greatest swordsman in the
        world, in order to honor a promise he made to his deceased childhood
        friend Kuina.[24]
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to his infamy as one of the Straw Hats and as a former
        bounty hunter, Zoro is also regarded as one of twelve pirates who are
        referred to as the "Worst Generation".[25] He gained his first bounty of
        Beli.png60,000,000 after the Arabasta Arc. It later increased to
        Beli.png120,000,000 after the Enies Lobby incident, then again to
        Beli.png320,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc.[16] Following the Raid on
        Onigashima, his bounty was increased to Beli.png1,111,000,000.[15]

      <h2>Powers and Abilities</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Zoro has devoted his life to becoming the world's strongest swordsman.
        Even before joining the crew, he was well-renowned for his outstanding
        abilities and accomplishments in battle. His skills drastically improved
        after becoming the combatant of the Straw Hat Pirates and entering a
        two-year training period under the "Strongest Swordsman in the World",
        Dracule Mihawk.[19] By the time he met Luffy, Zoro had established
        himself as a fearsome bounty hunter in the East Blue, so much so that
        Koby had heard he was a "demon in the form of a man". His
        accomplishments in hunting pirates were significant enough to earn him
        the epithet of "Pirate Hunter", which he remains known for even after
        becoming a pirate.[20][21] After his crushing loss to Dracule Mihawk, he
        vowed never to lose again.[22] Since joining the crew, Zoro has defeated
        several mighty adversaries (most of whom are fellow swordsmen)

      <h2>Personality And Relationship</h2>
      <hr />
      <h3>Personality</h3>
      <p>
        Zoro usually maintains a very stern, serious, and distanced personality,
        but often loses his temper in a goofy and exaggerated comical style. It
        would seem however, that this anger is the only emotion that Zoro often
        feels comfortable showing. Outside of situations where he feels
        confident in battle, he tends to smile or laugh the least out of the
        Straw Hats and rarely fools around with the rest of the crew and likes
        to distance himself more to sleep or train. In fact, his defeat at the
        hands of Dracule Mihawk and subsequent vow to Monkey D. Luffy is the
        only time since his friend Kuina passed that Zoro has been seen crying
        in the series.
      </p>
      <h3>Relationship</h3>
      <p>
        Though not as much with strangers, Zoro is always ready to protect and
        save his comrades whenever they are in danger, even at the cost of his
        own life. For example, in Skypiea, when he noticed the Going Merry being
        dragged away, he told everyone to leave the ship, saying he would stay
        back alone and protect it. Furthermore, he was willing to trade his life
        for Luffy's when Kuma first attacked the Straw Hats and he knocked Sanji
        unconscious when the latter tried to intervene. Another example is when
        Usopp was trying to escape from a Pacifista while dragging an injured
        Zoro; during which, despite the severity of his injuries, he told Usopp
        to escape and let him fight, which the latter objected against. Zoro is
        usually distant with the crew, as he frequently trains in the lookout or
        sleeps. Only coming out to tell Luffy, Usopp and Chopper to quiet down
        or when the crew gathers together, the two crewmates Zoro interacts the
        most with is Nami and Sanji (by way of arguing).
